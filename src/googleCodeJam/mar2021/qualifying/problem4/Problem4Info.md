# 2021 - Qualifying Round - Problem 4 - Median Sort
## Important Info
- Interactive problem
- There is an unseen list of items that needs to be sorted
- Three items' indexes can be passed to the judge system as a space-separated list for comparison, the judge will return the median item's index (the index of the item that is neither the largest nor the smallest)
    - There is a limit to the number of comparisons that can be made for a given test set
- Once the list's order has been deduced, pass the indexes of the elements in sorted order to the judge system as a space-separated list. The judge will confirm the correct answer with a 1 or -1
    - The list may be either correct or reversed (as median cannot tell you which end the list begins)
- Interaction begins by printing the number of test cases, the size of the list, and the number of queries allowed as a space-separated list
    - List size and allowed queries is the same for all test cases in a given test set
